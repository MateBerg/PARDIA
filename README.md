PARDIA is a simple yet open-source tool designed to use image processing capabilities, with a special focus on analyzing papyrus images. 
Built with `Python` and `CustomTkinter`, it offers a user-friendly interface for performing various image operations, including morphological transformations and HSV color detection.

### Key Features
- Real-time Image Editing: Quickly apply edits and see the results instantly.
- HSV Color Detection: Simplify the process of detecting colors in papyrus images.
- Morphological Operations: Explore structural changes with easy-to-use morphological tools.
- Simple Interface: Enjoy a clean and straightforward interface, making image processing accessible to everyone.

### Future Plans
- We're always looking to add more features to PARDIA.
- Adding linear filters
- Laplacian, and Sobel Filters
- Canny Edge Detection
- Applying and getting Contours

### Getting Started
